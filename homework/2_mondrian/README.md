## `🧪` Results

---
## `✅` Requirements
> - The painting should be recreated entirely using `<div>` colored with CSS background-color.
> - Some `<div>` will be container `<div>` that are invisible, but divide up space.
> - Use `%` units, allow the painting to take up the full canvas of the HTML page, it’s okay if it appears stretched if the window is also stretched.
## `💳` Extra Credit<br>
> get rid of the outer border, which requires specifically targeting the certain sides (top, left..) of a border.
