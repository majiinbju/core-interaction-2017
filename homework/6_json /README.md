> - this .json file will contain information about you. Read carefully to make sure content is structured uniformly. The top level will contain 4 keys: `‚Äúname‚Äù ‚Äúhome‚Äù ‚Äúurl‚Äù ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù:`
> - `‚Äúname‚Äù` should be an array with strings. Put as many names as you like, in the order you prefer. Mine looks like this: `[‚ÄúRobby‚Äù, ‚ÄúKraft‚Äù]`
> - ‚Äúhome‚Äù should be an object with 2 keys, `latitude` and `longitude`, each value is a number. This is the location you come from or where were you born. Whatever you call your first home.
