## `ðŸŽ¯` Objective
> - [Jean Baudrillard](http://s18coreinteraction.teachinginter.net/readings/Baudrillard-TheSystemofCollecting.pdf) outlines collections as the collective separation of objects of their utility. An object within a true collection becomes purely aesthetic. A true collection acts as a mirror to its ownerâ€” it is given and retains meaning through the owner's presence and care.
> - The first part of our final project consists of organizing your collection through the design and development of a JSON-fed website. In creating this website, you should consider the following questions:
> - Does your collection have a thesis?
> - What opinion (or opinions) can you present through your collection?
> - What does organizing this collection begin to reveal?
> - What patterns are present? What discrepancies?
> - What themes does this collection hold?
> - How does the siteâ€™s design reflect the structures of the collection?
> - What are your organizing principles? Are they identical with how the siteâ€™s content is navigable?
> - Continue refining your collectionâ€™s scope
> - Continue refining the design of your collectionâ€™s site. _Your siteâ€™s design should act as a visual prototype so that you can begin translating it into html next week._
> - Construct a JSON object of your collection and have it export its contents onto an html page
> - Begin to organize this collection through the design and development of a simple website.

## `ðŸ§ª` Results
> - For this website I decided to construct a collection of frames from one of my favourite movies: La Haine. 
> - Since the entire movie is filmed in black and white, I decided to harness this idea to my advantage by pairing it along with colour changes used to exhibit emotion. Each hue invokes a different facet of that emotion. 
> - The typography is directly inspired by the movie. All three phrases translate into the respective character's personality. For example, _Arash Te Mere_ is a French cuss, and thus I attributed it to the character Vinz, who displays the most aggression.
